My Master Degree Project in Information Technology
# SMART HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM

 Development of a cost-effective smart home automation project for Master Degree Programme in Information Technology at National Open University of Nigeria, Abuja.

The system implements the control of the devices via Wi-Fi connection using an android phone or any internet enabled device. Users can monitor and control the home appliances using their smart phone or tablet from any location. The appliances can also be automated through the timer feature and with voice command using google assistant. The motion detector provides additional security features against intruders as the alarm comes up when an object is detected by the motion sensor.
